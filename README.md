It has been noted that the number of people suffering from mental illness has skyrocketed from 7% in 2009 to 45% in 2022. That means every 1-in-7 people across the world is suffering from mental illness. Sadly, the number is more for younger people. 

We consulted a professional from a mental hospital and identified these major issues:

1. In order to conduct therapies (like Systematic desensitization therapy: A patient is put into a situation that he/she has the trauma of, and then the intensity is increased and the patient is monitored simultaneously by an expert), it is not possible to go to the environment required easily. So, it becomes a less efficient and costly procedure to conduct the therapy.

2. Stage fear and unable to express oneself is recognized as a major issue due to which one feels low and sometimes goes into depression. Only a few try to overcome this fear because they don't know how to overcome it.

3. People don't consider themselves ill or depressed. So, they don't visit the hospital or therapy centers. 

4. A stereotype is that therapies are too costly, which is true up to a point. But, if we see all the arrangements and skills put into work, the cost is justified. So, lowering the cost is a great challenge for hospitals and therapists.

5. Technology has found its way into the medical field in many sectors, but this sector remains highly undeveloped in countries like India
